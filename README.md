"Single-cell Hi-C analysis revealed that chromatin architectural heterogeneity serves as an initial cue underlying differential developmental potential and gene expression profiles in early pig embryos".

We applied single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to analyze 3D genome organization and transcriptional dynamics during early embryogenesis in porcine embryos, including both in vitro fertilized (IVF) and parthenogenetic (PA) conditions.
