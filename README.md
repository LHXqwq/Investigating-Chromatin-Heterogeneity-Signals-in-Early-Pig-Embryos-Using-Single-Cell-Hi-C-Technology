This repository contains the key analysis code used in the study:
"Investigating-Chromatin-Heterogeneity-Signals-in-Early-Pig-Embryos-Using-Single-Cell-Hi-C-Technology".

We applied single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to analyze 3D genome organization and transcriptional dynamics during early embryogenesis in porcine embryos, including both in vitro fertilized (IVF) and parthenogenetic (PA) conditions.
